# English Style Guide

This is an English style guide that we should follow to stay consistent in how we refer to common things in tutorials.

In general, we follow the [AP style guide](https://www.apstylebook.com/) and the [Apple Style Guide](http://help.apple.com/applestyleguide/#/). This guide has some tweaks and clarifications on top of those. It also covers terms used within Unity tutorials. Finally, we use Amreican English spellings in our publications; [see below for some resources](#other-style-guidelines) on working with American English vs British English.

## iOS Terms and Capitalization

_Capitalize and style terms as below._

**app**
Use _app_ instead of _application_, unless _application_ is more clear or refers to a non-iOS or Android, or other mobile entity.

**app delegate**

**app group**

**Auto Layout**

**back end, back-end, backend**
"back end" is a noun. You develop the back end. 
"back-end" functions as a (compound) modifier and is hyphenated before a noun. You are the back-end developer who developed the back end. 
"backend" is used in the BFF pattern (Backend for Frontend) 

You are the back-end developer who used the Backend for Frontend pattern to develop the back end.

**base 10**
...or base 2 or base 16 or base 8 when “binary”, “hexadecimal” or “octal” won't do. No hyphenation.

**Bézier curves**

**Boolean**
In honor of George Boole. :]

**build and run**
Use lowercase and do not bold.

**button**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**client-side**

**CocoaPod**

**Cocos2d**
Whether and how to capitalize this (_cocos2d? Cocos2D?_) has been notoriously difficult to pin down, but currently, _Cocos2d_ seems to be the most common form.

**Control-click**

**Control-drag**

**data**

The word is plural. Data are, not data is. Except for Lt. Commander Data. He's singular.

There are a few cases where **data** can be considered a singular, collective noun, when you consider the various pieces of data as a set. E.g.: The data is correct. (The data, as a singular collective unit, is correct.) One gigabyte of data **is** a lot of information to sort through.

**delight**

Please refrain from using this word when talking about UI animations. You’re a better writer than that.

**document outline**
Apple tends to use the term _outline view_ in its documentation, so that is OK as well; however, use one or the other for consistency.

**double-click**

**drop-down**

**e-commerce**

**editors**
Use lowercase; e.g. _assistant editor_, _standard editor_, _scene editor_.

**Face ID**

**frame rate**
_FPS_ not _fps_

**front end, front-end, frontend**
"front end" is a noun. You develop the front end. 
"front-end" functions as a (compound) modifier and is hyphenated before a noun. You are the front-end developer who developed the front end. 
"frontend" is used in the BFF pattern (Backend for Frontend) 

You are the front-end developer who used the Backend for Frontend pattern to develop the front end. 

**Git**
Unless you're specifically referring to a command using the tool, Git should be a proper noun. When used as a command, make sure to mark it as code: `git`.

**GitHub**

**glance**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**Gmail**

**group**

**he/she, he or she**
Default to "they" instead. If you want to go the distance and correct some of the gender imbalance in this industry, use "she" if you like.

**him/her, him or her**
Use "them" instead. If you want to go the distance and correct some of the gender imbalance in this industry, use "her" if you like.

**his/her, his or her**
Use "their" instead. If you want to go the distance and correct some of the gender imbalance in this industry, use "her" if you like.

**hard-coded** as an adjective to describe something, but **hard code** when giving an instruction.

**image view**

**In-App Purchase**
When referring to the feature or API. As a singular instance, simply in-app purchase.

**information**
Please, not "info". 

**inspectors**
Capitalize when it's a button name or in a menu command. Otherwise, spell with a lowercase _i_. When referring to panes in Xcode, capitalize the name of the pane but not "inspector"; e.g., _Attributes inspector_, _File inspector_, _Size inspector_.

**Interface Builder**

**interface controller**
Use lowercase, even when referring a specific, named instance such as _the_ `GroceryList` _interface controller._

**internet**
Not Internet.

**iOS 7, iOS 8**
Not _iOS7_ or _iOS8_.

**iPhone 4s, 5s, 5c, SE, 6c, 6s, X, XR, Xs**
Not _iPhone 4S, 5S, 5C, Se, 6C, 6S, x, Xr, Xs, etc._ This is as per Apple.

**JavaScriptCore**

**key-value pair**
Not "key/value pair".

**keyboard keys**
Spell out and capitalize, whether alone or in multi-press combinations: **Shift-Command-Option-X**.

You _press_ keys, you don't _type_ or _hit_ them.

**label**
Use lowercase, including when instructing the reader to drag one into the scene.

**login, log in**
"log in" is the verb. You log in to your WordPress account to write your tutorial.
"login" is the adjective (or, if you _really_ must, the noun). "WordPress gives you access to writing tools when it processes your login request."

**long-press**

**MacBook**

**macOS**

**menu**

We use the "▸" character for menu separators. To wit: "File ▸ New ▸ From Template". The use of the backslashes — "File\New\From Template" — has been deprecated. However, please continue to use forward slashes as path separators as in "myproject/assets/puppy.jpg".

```none
▸
BLACK RIGHT-POINTING SMALL TRIANGLE
Unicode: U+25B8, UTF-8: E2 96 B8
```

**minigame**

**navigators**
Capitalize when it's a button name or in a menu command. Otherwise, spell with a lowercase _n_. When referring to panes in Xcode, capitalize the name of the pane but not "navigator"; e.g., _Project navigator_, _Issue navigator_, _Test navigator_.

**Notification Center**
But a specific instance is usually termed "the user notification center" in lowercase.
When using the official term, do not include an article. "Send a notification to Notification Center." 

**Object Library**

**Objective-C**, not Objective C or Obj-C.

**OK**
Don't use _okay_ or _Ok_.

**offscreen**

**onscreen**

**open-source**

**OS X**
Don't use _OS X_ or _OSX_; it's now macOS.

**playground**

**Podfile**

**pop-up**

**Retina and non-Retina**

**right-click**

**results sidebar**
Area to the right-hand side of a playground showing the return value of a statement

**SceneKit**

**server-side**

This extends to the name of the Server-Side Swift pillar. This does not extend to the titles of our books.

**setup, set up, set-up**

"Set up" is the verb, where you _set up_ your computer.
"Setup" is the noun. The Catterwauls have quite a _setup_ in their video studio.

Take care of those first two forms properly and you’ve covered 95% of cases.

"Set-up" is a common adjectival noun: My mobile carrier has a steep _set-up_ fee. But I wouldn’t slap anyone with a trout for using the above noun form instead: a steep _setup_ fee

**simulator**
_iOS Simulator_ is a simulator app. Generally speaking, use lowercase _simulator_ unless you omit the article:

_Correct:_ run in the simulator  
_Correct:_ run in iOS Simulator _(note lack of article)_  
_Incorrect_: run in the Simulator

It's OK to both use an article and capitalize _Simulator_ if you are using it as an attributive noun:

_Correct:_ close the Simulator window

**size classes**

**SpringBoard**

**SpriteKit**

**storyboard**

**superclass**

**Swift**

**SwiftNIO**
Not "Swift NIO", "Swift-NIO" or "NIO".

**Swift standard library**
Not Swift Standard Library

**terminal**
macOS includes a terminal emulator program called _Terminal_. Generally speaking, use lowercase _terminal_ unless you omit the article:

_Correct:_ close the terminal  
_Correct:_ open a terminal window  
_Correct:_ use the terminal command  
_Correct:_ enter the following command into Terminal _(note lack of article)_  
_Correct:_ open Terminal _(note lack of article)_  
_Incorrect:_ open the Terminal

It's OK to both use an article and capitalize _Terminal_ if you are using it as an attributive noun: 

_Correct:_ open a Terminal window  
_Correct:_ use the Terminal command  
_Correct:_ open the Terminal application

**Today**
As in Today extension, Today view, etc.

**top shelf**
No definite consensus on this one from Apple (Top Shelf is used as well); the top area of the tvOS Home Screen.

**Touch ID**

**view controller / View controller**

Use view controller when speaking of an instance in general. 

Use View control to reference the four-button unit for changing views of Finder windows. The View control comprises the Icon View button, the List View button, the Column View button and the Cover Flow button. 

**Watch app**
Not _watch app_ or _Watch App_.

**web service**
Two words, lowercased. 

**Wi-Fi**
This is actually a trademark, though usage doesn't require additional decoration.

**Xcode**

## Other Style Guidelines

**above** and **below**
In situations like these: “Here’s how the above function works” and “Add the below function,” "above" and "below" should follow the noun. So it should be: “Here’s how the function above works...” and “Add the function below...”

**American vs. British English**
Use American English in your articles. If you aren't sure if you're using the right version, you can refer to this [American to British dictionary](http://projectbritain.com/americanbritish/index.html), check a list of common [American vs. British idioms](https://www.italki.com/article/126/up-to-you-or-down-to-you-some-differences-between-british-and-american-english-idioms?hl=en), or paste your text into a [British to American converter](https://www.infoenglish.net/british-to-american-english/). You can also read this [comprehensive guide to British vs. American language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_American_and_British_English) on Wikipedia.

**Apple**
Use the pronoun *it* to refer to Apple and any other company or organization; do not use *they*.

_Example:_ Apple has its own solution...

**as-is**

**bolding**
Use the bold style (&lt;em&gt; in WordPress) for things the reader needs to click, modify, enter into a text field or otherwise notice. This includes file and directory names, but only those that are the action item of a nearby instruction.

When instructing the reader to makes changes, bold each object in the process, with the exception of UI elements.

_Example:_ In the hierarchy, select the **SpaceShip** and from the inspector, inside the **Alien Component**, set the **IsDead** property to **false**.

Also use the bold style to highlight important concepts that are being introduced for the first time.

For bolding in lists, see **lists**.

**book references**
References to other books should be italicized: 

_Example:_ If you’re new to iOS development, we recommend you start with _iOS Apprentice_.

**chapter references**
When referring to chapters in the same book, give the chapter number and place the chapter title in quotes: 

_Example:_ Chapter 15, “Performance Tips and Tricks”

References to chapters in other books can be written as follows:

_Example:_ Check out the “Doing Cool Stuff” chapter of _Ray’s Awesome Book_.

**checkbox** 
Not check box. Note that we don't "tick" check boxes, since tha's British English. We either select or check them.

**code objects**
Methods, functions, protocols, classes, structs, variables and so on — those things that are properly marked inline as code — are treated as proper nouns. "Add the following to `generateLotteryTicket()`:", not "Add the following to the `generateLotteryTicket()` method".

**contractions**
In general, prefer contractions to the alternative as they enhance the conversational style of our writing.

**coordinates**
_(x, y)_ not _(x,y)_

Note that _coordinate_ refers to one of the group (_the x-coordinate_), while _coordinates_ refers to more than one and usually the entire group (_the GPS coordinates of Cupertino_).

**emoticons**
These are not punctuation; sentences that end with an emoticon still need appropriate punctuation that should fall before the emoticon rather than after it.

**file extensions**
either _XXX_ or _.xxx_

**functions**
see _code objects_.

**game references**
Italicize the names of published games, like _Super Mario Bros._ or _Angry Birds_, but not the names of other software.

**headers**

* _Casing in tutorials:_ Capitalize headers, leaving any article, preposition or coordinating conjunction that is three letters or less lowercase, unless it is the first word in the heading. For example, it is important to capitalize the verb _Go_ but _not_ the word _to_ in **Where to Go From Here?**</li>

* _Casing in books:_ Use sentence casing by capitalizing only the first letter of the first word, except for proper nouns. So **Where to go from here?** or **New features in Swift**</li>

* _Placement:_ Insert when the subject moves from one point to another; more subheadings are usually better than fewer. Also ensure that if H2 and H3 headers are used, they are nested appropriately. For example, there's no point in having a single H2 and then seventeen H3 headings for the rest of the article.</li>

**home page**

**ID** not id.

**it** or **that**
Make sure that if you use "it" or "that" in place of a noun, it's abundantly clear what you are referring to. Avoid ambiuity.

**inline code**
Use the inline code style (&lt;code&gt; in WordPress) for all class, function and method names. Remember to use it for these words:

`nil`  
`if` statement  
`while` loop  
`if-else`  
`Int`  
`enum`  
`switch` statement

**in order to...**
In almost all cases, "In order to..." can be shortened to "To..." This tightens your prose and saves time for your readers.

**lists**
List items should be followed by colons, not dashes.

If a list includes items, bold them (&lt;em&gt; in WordPress). If the list items are code structures, use the bold style rather than the inline code style. The colon should appear _outside_ of the bold formatting. 

**methods**
see _code objects_.

**numbers vs. numerals**
Spell out whole numbers up to and including nine, as well as larger numbers that can be expressed in one or two words.

_Examples:_ zero, one, nine, six million.

Use numerals for numbers greater than nine; for decimals and percentages; for numbers that express mathematical figures; for addresses, dates, the time of day, and page or chapter numbers; and when a numeral is important for identification purposes.

_Examples:_ 10; 25,000; 30%; divide 15 by 3; Chapter 6; Highway 4; Room 2.

Numbers in series should be consistent.

_Example:_ She went to five countries on four continents in sixteen days _OR_ She went to 5 countries on 4 continents in 16 days.  
_Example:_ The final score was 13–1 _OR_ The final score was thirteen to one.

_Note:_ There are a lot of exceptions to these basic rules, so use your best judgment.

**pluralization**
For acronyms, such as API, no apostrophe is necessary as per AP style.

Wrong: API’s

Right: APIs

**protocols**
see _code objects_.

**quotation marks**

AP style: Periods and commas always go within quotation marks. Dashes, semicolons, question marks and exclamation points go within quotation marks when they apply to the quoted matter only. They go outside quotation marks when they apply to the whole sentence.

**raywenderlich.com**
When referring to the website or our tutorials, refer to it as "raywenderlich.com" in all lower case. Not mixed case (RayWenderlich) or two words (Ray Wenderlich).

**screen gestures**
You _tap_ something on a screen, you don't _click_, _touch_ or _press_ it; the only exception to this is a _long press_ on an object on the phone's screen.

**up**
Don't use "up" as an adverb unless it is absolutely necessary. For example, "open up" can almost always be shortened to "open."

**URL**
Write URLs in lowercase, and leave off the leading www if possible: raywenderlich.com. No special formatting required when the website is part of the main body text.

**variables**
see _code objects_.

**× vs. x**

When you’re discussing a 10×10 array, use the typographically correct multiplication symbol **×**, as opposed to the letter **x** or, worse, **X**.

## Android Terms and Capitalization 

Kotlin Standard Library (when talking about the official Library) 

## Unity Terms and Capitalization

_Capitalize and style terms as below:_

Animator window  
  
animation  

Animation view  
  
camera (when talking about the GameObject or when talking about cameras in general)  
  
Camera (when talking about the Camera component)

component  

coroutine 

Game view  

GameObject  

gizmo

Hierarchy

Inspector

Mecanim  
  
MonoBehaviour
  
object

prefab

Project window

runtime

scene

Scene view  
  
script

Shaders

sprite

Transform  

toolbar  

UI 

Unity editor


## Other Unity Style Guidelines

**animated GIFs** Use animated GIFs only once for an operation. When repeating the operation, use either a screenshot or refer the reader back to the animated GIF.

**project assets** All assets in a project should be named using UpperCamelCase.

**spoilers** Use spoilers to "quiz" readers on repeated operations in the tutorial.

**script vs component** When talking about the actual .cs file (and the MonoBehaviour class that's inside) call it a **script**, when you're in the editor and you take that **script** and attach it to a GameObject, refer to it as a **component** ("instance" of a script).  
  
**camera vs Camera** Some common terms like camera, light, collider also have components that are named the same. This can get confusing sometimes. Therefore, when referring to a **common GameObject** (e.g. the **camera**) use lowercase, when referring specifically to the  attached **component** use UpperCamelCase.

**Vector representations** If you describe a **Vector2**, **Vector3** or similar data, use this notation: **(X:1, Y:2, Z:3)**

## Apple Watch Style Guidelines

**complications**

**Digital Crown**
"the Digital Crown" when referring to the hardware component, but "Digital Crown" when referring to the API.

**Dock**
Also "the Dock"
When referring more generally to a location you choose to store files, "dock" with lowercasing is appropriate. 

**Home screen**
Also "the Home screen"

**Time Travel**

**WatchKit**

## Serial (Oxford) Commas

In general, digital copy looks best when the serial comma is NOT used. This is the general direction followed by several (but not all!) modern style manuals.

An example of the serial comma in use: "Ray wrote three posts, two product reviews, and a scathing exposé on Android."

The preferred practice is to remove the final comma in the list of elements (the one usually before the 'and', 'or' or 'nor' ): "Ray wrote three posts, two product reviews and a scathing exposé on Android."

However, retain the extra comma when necessary to avoid ambiguity: "Ray loves his employees, Tim Cook and Steve Ballmer." Well, we're pretty sure Tim Cook and Steve Ballmer don't work for Ray (just yet), so leave the comma in to be clear: "Ray loves his employees, Tim Cook, and Steve Ballmer."

But beware - the presence of AND following a comma does not imply a serial comma is in use: "Ray continues to throw fits when he sees a serial comma in use, and it's really nervewracking for editors to see their fearless leader in such a despondent state." Here you have two independent clauses that could be written as two separate sentences without losing meaning: "Ray continues to throw fits when he sees a serial comma in use. It's really nervewracking for editors to see their fearless leader in such a despondent state." However, the two share a common idea or thread and you can join them with a comma and a conjunction as I did above.
